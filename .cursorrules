# Monthly Report Slideshow Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Context

This project is a professional slideshow presentation system for monthly work reports, built as a completely isolated sub-project in `v_repor_/`.

## Project Origins & Acknowledgments

This project was built based on the following sources:

### Planning Documents

1. **Project Plan**: `docs/monthly-report-slideshow-project.plan.md`
   - Comprehensive phased implementation plan (11 phases)
   - Defines project structure, components, animations, and deployment strategy
   - Includes detailed specifications for all features and components
   - Animation system with 7 base types (fade, slideUp, slideDown, slideLeft, slideRight, scale, rotate)
   - Combination system for multiple simultaneous animations

2. **Raw Plan**: `docs/my_raw_plan.md`
   - Initial requirements and specifications
   - Original design concepts and feature requests
   - Component requirements and animation specifications
   - Design requirements (header, footer, grid view, etc.)

### Data Source

3. **Report Data**: `docs/October_2025_Report.md`
   - October 2025 work report used as JSON data source
   - Contains feature summaries, task lists, and statistics
   - Structured by Feature and Type categories
   - Handler: Vothana CHY
   - Period: October 1-31, 2025

## Project Architecture

- **Framework**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Libraries**: PrimeVue, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations**: GSAP
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Module System**: ES Modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Design Principles

1. **Reusability**: Designed to be reusable for future monthly reports
2. **Data-Driven**: Architecture allows easy integration of new report data
3. **Animation System**: Flexible animation system with combinable base types
4. **Responsive**: Grid view with responsive columns (sm:3, md:4, lg:5, xl:6)
5. **Professional**: Custom theme with primary color #045174

## Component Structure

- **Layout Components**: AppHeader, AppFooter, MainWrapper, ContentTypeTag
- **Slide Components**: SlideCard, SlideImageContainer, SlideTextContainer, SlidesContainer
- **UI Components**: GridView
- **Composables**: useSlideshow, useGSAPAnimations, useSlideNavigation, useDarkMode

## Data Structure

- Report data parsed from markdown into structured JSON
- Slide cards with configurable animations, backgrounds, images, and content
- Support for intro card, content cards, and thank you card
- Image support (URL and local paths) with multiple layout options

## When Working on This Project

- Always refer to the original plan documents for context
- Maintain the data-driven architecture for reusability
- Follow the animation system specifications (7 base types, combinable)
- Keep the project isolated (own dependencies, no sharing with parent project)
- Use ES module syntax throughout
- Maintain professional design standards with theme color #045174
